# Ground-Vibration-Prediction-in-blasting-using-Neural-Network

Blasting operation is an important element of the mining system that includes drilling, blasting, loading, haulage, crushing and disposal. Blasting operation has to be designed to provide optimum rock fragmentation at minimum cost while considering environmental concerns. One of the important adverse effects of the use of explosives is ground vibration. The main parameters that are effective on occurrence of vibration may be divided into two groups. The first group consists of blast design parameters. The blast design parameters are controllable parameters and determined by the explosive engineers. The burden, spacing between holes, bench height, drill hole diameter, stemming height and sub drilling are all design parameters. The second group consists of rock mass parameters that are referred to as uncontrollable parameters. Various research studies have been performed to create a predictive equation for blast vibration. Because of the complexity of blast design parameters and rock mass parameters, it is difficult to develop a general equation. The blast researchers perform site-specific studies to predict and control blast vibration. The peak particle velocity (PPV) is accepted as a principal parameter for vibration measurement. The vertical, longitudinal and transverse components of the seismic waves are measured by blast seismographs. The blasting researchers generally create a blast database that contains measured blast design parameters and particle velocity values to create a predictive equation by regression analysis. This approach considers raw measured blast data to predict ground vibrations.
Prediction of ground vibration is of great importance in mitigation of blast-induced adverse effects. In this project, neural network used  for prediction of blast-induced ground vibration . Blast design parameters and the parameters related to ground vibration was considered to perform analysis. 

# Blast design parameters
# 1. Burden (B):
This is one of the most critical parameter in designing of blast. It is the distance from a charge axis to the nearest free face at the time of detonation .As the boreholes with lower delay periods detonates, they create new free faces. As a result the effective burden will depend upon the selection of the delay pattern. When the distance between discontinuities is larger, smaller burden is required.

# 2. Spacing (S):
Spacing is an important parameter in blast design. It is defined as the distance between any two adjacent charges in the same row and it controls mutual stress effect between charges. Spacing is calculated as a function of burden, hole depth, relative primer location between adjacent charges and depends upon initiation time interval. Over past several decades in most mining operations the spacing distances have been decided in relation to burden. The value  of the spacing to burden ratio (S: B) which has been commonly used in different formulas lies between 1 and 2. From the production scale test with the spherical charges breaking to crater geometry, many workers suggested that the spacing be kept about 1.3 times the burden.
 
# 3. Powder Factor (PF):
The powder factor is defined as the explosive necessary to fragment 1 m3 of rock. This equation can also be defined as the amount of explosives over the cubic yards of material desired to be blasted.
                                             Kg of explosive used/volume of material blasted. =kg/ m 3
                                             
It is the opinion of many specialists this is not the best tool for designing a blast, unless it is referring to pattern explosives or expressed as energetic consumption. The size of the fragmented rock should match the bucket size of the excavator and also the grizzly size of the primary crusher. it can be also expressed in ton/kg.

# 4. Maximum charge per delay (MCPD): 
it is the maximum quantity of explosive charge detonated on one interval (delay) within a blast. It is the charge detonated within any 8 ms interval over the entire duration of the blast

# 5. distance(D) :
it is the distance from the blasting site to the seismograph to measure the ground vibration.
